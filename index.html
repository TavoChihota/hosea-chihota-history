        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p><strong>Chiremba (Isaac / Murengwe)</strong> was a traditional healer who settled in the Epworth area (formerly Chinamano). He had originally come to heal the local leader <strong>Chiriusa</strong>, whose home was near present-day Jaggers Msasa.</p>

        <p>In 1891, Methodist missionaries arrived in Chinamano, and Chiremba became the <strong>first recorded person in Zimbabwe to convert to Methodism</strong>.</p>

        <p>His two sons <strong>David / Tirivai</strong> and <strong>Mugoniwa</strong> passed away during the influenza pandemic between 1915 and 1918. Their brother <strong>Jonas / Marimbi</strong> took in their children and relocated to Seke, where Chief Seke granted them land.</p>

        <p>This land became present-day <strong>Jonas / Marimbi Village</strong>, where Jonas established the <strong>Jonas Methodist Church</strong> and <strong>Jonas Primary School</strong>.</p>

        <p>The children taken to Seke were: <strong>Heveniza</strong>, <strong>Hosea</strong>, <strong>Hakishi</strong>, <strong>Josias</strong>, <strong>Philip</strong>, <strong>Esther</strong>, and <strong>Benjamin</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Hosea’s Life and Marriage</h2>

        <p>Hosea grew up in Jonas Village and often travelled to Epworth to visit relatives. He worked as a <strong>tinsmith</strong>, <strong>builder</strong>, and <strong>tricycle repairer</strong>. His craftsmanship benefited the community, and he went on to train his nephews and other locals.</p>
